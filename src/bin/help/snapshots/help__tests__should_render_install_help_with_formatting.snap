    [3msdk install[0m - sdk subcommand to install a candidate version

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
    [3msdk install <candidate> [version] [path][0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    Invoking this subcommand with only the candidate as parameter will install
    the currently known default version for that candidate. Provide a second
    qualifier to install a specific non-default version. Provide a third
    optional qualifier to add an already installed local version. This final
    qualifier is the absolute local path to the base directory of the SDK to
    be added. The local version will appear as an installed version of the
    candidate. The version may not conflict with an existing version, installed
    or not.

[1mEXIT CODE[0m
    The subcommand will return a non-zero exit code for versions not found or
    for an invalid path.

[1mMNEMONIC[0m
